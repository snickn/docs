title: How We Operate - Discovery and Delivery
description: An overview of how the Product team at DataBank makes decisions, validates ideas, and delivers high-quality solutions using a structured, repeatable process.
---

At DataBank, the Product team is process-driven by design.

We don‚Äôt just launch features. We use a structured, proven approach to understand problems, align stakeholders, and build the right solutions ‚Äî at the right time ‚Äî for our business and our customers.

This page explains how we work, what artifacts we use, and how we ensure that our products are **strategic, scalable, and reliable**.

## üõ†Ô∏è A Process You Can Trust

Every product or feature we build follows two key phases:

### ‚úÖ 1. Discovery ‚Äì _Are we solving the right problem?_

We start every initiative by exploring:

- Who is this for?
- What problem are we solving?
- Why now?
- What does success look like?

This prevents wasted effort, uncovers hidden risks, and ensures we're focused on real value.

### ‚úÖ 2. Delivery ‚Äì _Are we building the right thing, the right way?_

Once we‚Äôve aligned on the opportunity and scope, we shift into building mode ‚Äî collaborating across engineering, UX, security, and operations to bring the solution to life.

We build in two-week sprints, test thoroughly, and roll out with confidence.

## üß∞ Tools We Use (So You Know We‚Äôre Thinking Clearly)

We don‚Äôt ‚Äúwing it.‚Äù We use a consistent set of tools to frame decisions, document choices, and communicate across teams.

### üîç During Discovery, we use:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **1-Pager** | Frames the opportunity (problem, user, risks, success) |
| **PR/FAQ** | Tells the story of what we're building and why |
| **Jobs To Be Done** | Helps us understand what users *really* want |
| **Journey Maps** | Visualize pain points across a user or staff experience |
| **Assumption Maps** | Surface risky unknowns before we start building |
| **Hypothesis Canvas** | Convert assumptions into testable ideas |
| **Kano Model** | Helps prioritize must-haves vs. delighters |

These tools help us think clearly, collaborate effectively, and align early.

---

### üõ†Ô∏è During Delivery, we use:

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** | Defines scope, success criteria, and implementation details |
| **User Stories** | Break down work into testable, valuable chunks |
| **Wireframes & UI Specs** | Communicate what the experience should look and feel like |
| **Prototype Brief & Checklist** | Enable early validation and reduce rework |
| **Service Blueprint** | Map how the UI connects to backend systems and teams |
| **QA & Launch Checklists** | Ensure smooth rollouts, training, and go-live support |
| **Retrospective Guide** | Help teams reflect and continuously improve |

These artifacts are how we stay aligned across functions and deliver quality at scale.

## üìã The Product Playbook

All of these tools and templates are part of our internal **Product Playbook** ‚Äî a living document that Product Managers, UX Designers, and Analysts use to guide their work. 

We don‚Äôt use every tool every time. We adapt based on scope, risk, and context ‚Äî but the playbook gives us a **shared language and repeatable system** for doing great work together.

## ‚úÖ Why It Matters to You

When you work with Product, you can expect:

- Clear problem framing before anything is built
- Open collaboration and early involvement
- Consistent documentation and visibility
- Transparent prioritization and planning
- Stakeholder buy-in before launch

We believe great products are built **with** people, not just *for* them ‚Äî and that starts with trust in our process.
