description: "An overview of how the Product organization applies Scrum and continuous delivery to deliver value at a sustainable and predictable pace."
---

We follow Scrum as the foundation of our product delivery approach — but we've tailored it to meet the needs of our teams, our stakeholders, and our technology ecosystem.

This page outlines how Scrum works at DataBank, how we define “continuous delivery,” and how we release high-quality features with predictability and intention.

## 🔁 Sprint Cadence

We operate on **two-week sprints**, across all Scrum teams.

- **Sprint Planning**: Held at the start of each sprint to align on goals, priorities, and commitments.

- **Daily Standups**: Short daily meetings to share progress, identify blockers, and align cross-functionally.

- **Backlog Refinement**: Ongoing, usually mid-sprint, to prepare work for future sprints.

- **Sprint Reviews**: End-of-sprint demos to share what we delivered and gather feedback.

- **Sprint Retrospectives**: Team reflection and process improvement session held after every sprint.

## 🚀 Our Release Model

We practice a form of **continuous delivery**, with a deliberate and staged release flow that fits our ecosystem:

| **Stage**           | **Timeline**       | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Development Sprint  | Week 1–2           | Features are developed, tested, and validated internally.                       |
| Staging Release     | End of Sprint      | Completed work is pushed to the **Staging** environment for integration testing and UAT. |
| Production Release  | Following Week     | Work that passes staging validation is deployed to **Production**.              |

This creates a **one-week staging buffer** between development and production deployment — giving us space for feedback, testing, and alignment.

## 🤝 Why This Approach?

While daily releases work well for some teams, our delivery is shaped by:

- **ERP dependency**: Our core platform (DBOSS) is tightly integrated with **Epicor**, our ERP system, which requires coordination and controlled releases.

- **Operational alignment**: Many releases affect internal teams and processes — we strive for stability, predictability, and communication across departments.

- **Focus on value**: We prioritize delivering high-quality, validated work on a regular cadence — not just pushing code for the sake of speed.

This approach balances **agility with accountability**.

## 📦 What’s in a Sprint?

Each sprint includes:

- **Planned Stories**: Prioritized work with clear acceptance criteria, estimated in hours.

- **Design Handoff (if needed)**: Collaboration between UX and dev teams for ready-to-build features.

- **Test Coverage**: QA runs both automated and manual testing before staging release.

- **UAT Window**: Staging week includes UAT by internal stakeholders before production release.

---

## 🧪 Continuous Delivery, the DataBank Way

At DataBank, **continuous delivery** means:

- Every sprint results in potentially shippable, fully tested product increments.

- We ship to Staging continuously, and to Production **intentionally**, once work has passed validation.

- We release value on a regular, predictable rhythm that teams can trust.

It’s not about deploying daily — it’s about never being blocked from delivering.
