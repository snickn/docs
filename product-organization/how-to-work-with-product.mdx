## üí° Bringing Ideas to the Table

We welcome product ideas, problem statements, and feedback. The best ideas often come from those closest to our users.

**To submit an idea:**
- Use the [Product Intake Form](https://intake.databank.com) or Slack us in `#product-intake`.
- Include: what problem you're solving, who it's for, and any context/data.
- Optional: mockups, examples, or urgency level.

**What happens next:**
- Product reviews intake weekly.
- We'll follow up for clarification, validation, and prioritization.

## üîç During Discovery

When a product initiative is being explored:

- Expect discovery interviews, workshops, or whiteboard sessions.
- We may engage you to define the problem or walk through a workflow.
- You'll likely work with a **Product Owner**, **Business Analyst**, and **UX Designer**.

**What helps:**
- Be honest about pain points and constraints.
- Share relevant metrics, tools, or current state examples.
- Challenge assumptions ‚Äî we love a good debate.

## üõ†Ô∏è During Delivery

Once in development:

- The PO leads prioritization and backlog grooming.
- Expect regular demos, sprint reviews, and UAT opportunities.
- We focus on delivering iteratively ‚Äî value early, polish later.

**What helps:**
- Timely feedback on in-progress work.
- Clear expectations around launch impact.
- Participation in user acceptance testing (UAT).

## üöÄ After Launch

After we release something:

- We track adoption, usage, and sentiment.
- Your input shapes what we iterate on next.
- If you encounter bugs or issues, report them via [Slack]().

**What helps:**
- Celebrate wins and share feedback.
- Log pain points or questions as they arise.
- Help us drive adoption within your teams.

## ü§ù Collaboration Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Share early context, even if it's rough. | Wait until everything is ‚Äúfinal‚Äù to involve product. |
| Provide clear, actionable feedback. | Say ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt work‚Äù without examples. |
| Respect our planning cycles and timelines. | Expect ad-hoc scope changes mid-sprint. |
| Collaborate through Slack, Notion, and Jira. | Use email for urgent requests. |
